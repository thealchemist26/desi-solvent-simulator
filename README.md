# DESI Solvent Flow Simulator

## Overview

This Python application simulates the Desorption Electrospray Ionization (DESI) solvent flow over various fingerprint ridge patterns using the Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM). It provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for users to adjust simulation parameters and visualise the solvent flow in real-time. The current model is taking into account the fluid properties of the 95:5,Methanol:Water as the solvent system.

## Features

- Interactive GUI for adjusting DESI setup and fingerprint surface parameters
- Real-time visualization of solvent flow over the fingerprint surface
- Multiple ridge patterns: parallel lines, wavy lines, and whorls
- Adjustable parameters: spray angle, tip-to-surface distance, spray width, and more
- DESI schematic visualisation
- Wetting factor control for surface interaction simulation
- Added roughness to the fingerprint ridges to simulate real-life fingerprint morphology (NEW FEATURE)
  

## Dependencies

- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- PIL (Python Imaging Library)
- Tkinter
- SciPy

## Installation

1. Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system.
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install numpy matplotlib pillow scipy
   ```
3. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/thealchemist26/desi-solvent-flow-simulator.git
   cd desi-solvent-flow-simulator
   ```

## Usage

Run the script:
```bash
python desi_solvent_flow_simulator.py
```

1. The main application window and a schematic window will appear.
2. Adjust the simulation parameters using the sliders and dropdown menus.
3. Click "Initialize Simulation" to start or reset the simulation.
4. Use the "Flow Time Step" slider to advance the simulation and observe the flow patterns.

## Key Components
